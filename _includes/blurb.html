                <p class="text-faded">Begun in 2013, the <a href="https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/name">Harlem Education History Project</a> is <a href="https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/partners">a collaboration</a> among scholars, students, community members, teachers, technologists, and archivists to recognize, document, and share histories of education in Harlem. Students in <a href="https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/teaching">classes at Teachers College</a>, and community and local school partners recorded, collected, and interpreted oral histories and archival sources. Scholars from around the country produced the edited volume <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/educating-harlem/9780231182218"><em>Educating Harlem: A Century of Schooling and Resistance in a Black Community</em></a> published by Columbia University Press. These efforts were informed by <a href="https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/lectures">a lecture series</a>, <a href="https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/conference-2014">working conference</a>, and readings in an <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/316487/harlem_education_history_project">open bibliography</a>. To connect Harlem’s educational history with local and national communities, high-school students engage in  <a href="https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/yhh">Youth Historians in Harlem</a> classes and summer institutes, and teachers participate in a <a href="http://harlemeducationmovements.com/">National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Institute</a>. Together, this <a href="https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/project-updates">ongoing work</a> draws on Harlem’s rich tradition of Black educational visions to inform just education for the future.</p>
